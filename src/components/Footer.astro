    The wealth and prosperity of this region were built on the backs of East
    Asian and South Asian workers facing generations of discriminatory wages,
    dangerous working conditions and legal exclusion from the economy they
    helped create. This exploitation continues through the abuse of immigrants
    and the erosion of labor protections leaving the most vulnerable workers
    without recourse.
  </p>
  <p>
    We are now witnessing increased attacks on 2SLGBTQI+ rights and continued
    disinformation campaigns targeting progressive and environmental policies,
    as well as concerted efforts to undermine public services,
    disproportionately harming marginalized communities.
  </p>
  <p>
    As we go about our lives on these lands, may we never forget our
    responsibility to pursue the truth, reconciliation, and justice for those
    whose futures have been stolen and those who continue to suffer the legacy
    of systemic oppression.
  </p>
  <p>Only an equitable city can truly be a fun place to live.</p>
